React Notes

npm install
  (install dependencies)
npm start
  (make local server available)
localhost:8080
npm install --save
  -save this package to the package.json file
  -npm install --save youtube-api-search


Components
-javascript functions (code snippets) that produce HTML (views/templates)

const
  (making a variable that isn't going to change; constant)

  const App = function() {
    return <div>Hi!</div>;   (this code is called JSX)
  }

JSX
  -similar to HTML
  -cannot be understood by browser
  -produces HTML for DOM to register

*** SELF CLOSING TAG
  -nothing inside the opening and closing tag (shorthand)
  example:
    <div />
    <App />

  ReactDOM.render(<App />);

  //this App tag instantiates the app component


React vs ReactDOM
  -two libraries
    -React: main library that knows how to build components
    -ReactDOM: library that knows how to publish components to DOM

const App = () => {
  return <div>Hi!</div>;
}
    ***this is ES6 syntax called FAT ARROW (does act in place of function but DIFFERENT value of THIS)


ES6 Class
-Class Based Components
***Only class based components have STATE

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <input />;
  }
}

  -extends the Compnent class from React
  -render() similar to a function but more like an initialize

State
***Only class based components have STATE
  -whenever state changes
    -render function reruns
      -any children get rerun as well

  this.state = { term: '' }

    -initialize it with object { term: '' }
      -term = property on state
      -can record change on this property ('term')

  this.setState

    -only way to manipulate the state

Controlled Component
  -its value is controlled by state

Downward DataFlow
  -most parent component to handle fetch data
